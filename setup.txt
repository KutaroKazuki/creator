To fully host the client generator yourself, you will need to following:

1) A Github account that has a fork of rustdesk
2) A Github fine-grained access token with permissions for your rustdesk repository
3) An FTP server to upload the generated clients
4) On the server running the client generator:
    a) environment variables:
        GHUSER="your github username"
        GHBEARER="your fine-graned access token"
    b) github secrets:
        GENURL="example.com:8083"
        GEN_FTP_SERVER="ftp.example.com"
        GEN_FTP_USER="username"
        GEN_FTP_PASSWORD="password"
    c) optional github secrets (for signing the code):
        WINDOWS_PFX_BASE64
        WINDOWS_PFX_PASSWORD
        WINDOWS_PFX_SHA1_THUMBPRINT
5) A windows computer or VM that is set up to build rustdesk, and is setup as a self-hosted github runner
