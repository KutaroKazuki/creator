To fully host the client generator yourself, you will need to following:

1) A Github account with a fork of this repo
2) A Github fine-grained access token with permissions for your rdgen repository
    a) login to your github account
    b) click on your profile picture at the top right, click Settings
    c) at the bottom of the left panel, click Developer Settings
    d) click Personal access tokens
    e) click Fine-grained tokens
    f) click Generate new token
    g) give a token name, change expiration to whatever you want
    h) under Repository acces, select Only select repositories, then pick your rdgen repo
    i) give Read and Write access to actions and workflows
3) On the server running the client generator:
    a) environment variables:
        GHUSER="your github username"
        GHBEARER="your fine-graned access token"
    b) github secrets:
        GENURL="example.com:8083"
        GEN_FTP_SERVER="ftp.example.com"
        GEN_FTP_USER="username"
        GEN_FTP_PASSWORD="password"
    c) optional github secrets (for signing the code):
        WINDOWS_PFX_BASE64
        WINDOWS_PFX_PASSWORD
        WINDOWS_PFX_SHA1_THUMBPRINT
4) A windows computer or VM that is set up to build rustdesk, and is setup as a self-hosted github runner
